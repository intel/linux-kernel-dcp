Description:
		This folder contains interface files for accessing Intel
		Software Defined Silicon (SDSi) features on a CPU. X
		represent the socket instance (though not the socket id).

		Some files communicate with SDSi hardware through a mailbox.
		Should the operation fail, one of the following error codes
		may be returned:

		Error Code	Cause
	        ----------	-----
	        EIO		General mailbox failure. Log may indicate cause.
	        EBUSY		Mailbox is owned by another agent.
	        EPERM		SDSI capability is not enabled in hardware.
	        EPROTO		Failure in mailbox protocol detected by driver.
				See log for details.
	        EOVERFLOW	For provision commands, the size of the data
				exceeds what may be written.
	        ESPIPE		Seeking is not allowed.
	        ETIMEDOUT	Failure to complete mailbox transaction in time.

Description:
		(WO) Used to write a Capability Activation Payload (CAP) to the
		SDSi NVRAM for the CPU. CAP files are used to activate a given
		CPU feature. The CAP file is validated by SDSi hardware using a
		previously provision AKC file. Upon successful authentication, the
		CPU configuration is updated. A cold reboot is required to fully
		activate the feature. Mailbox command.
