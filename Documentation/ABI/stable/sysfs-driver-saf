Description:	SAF tunable parameters that user can modify before
		the scan run.

		Briefly, the files above are:

		core_delay: Minimum delay between core scans when
		running all core tests.

		noint: When set, no interrupt allowed when running
		scan. When unset, it allows interrupt.

		trigger_mce: When set, trigger a MCE when the test fails.

		thread_wait: The maximum time to allow microcode to wait
		for a core and its sibling joining for synchronization.

Description:	SAF test content enumeration when SAF module is installed.
		These are read only parameters that reflect the details
		of the SAF image.

		Briefly, the files above are:

		num_chunks: The number of chunks in the SAF image.

		chunk_size: Chunk size of test in Byte.

		max_cores: Maximum number of cores that can run scan
		simultaneously.

		image_version: The SAF image revision.

Description:	SAF target core testing parameters.

		Briefly, the files above are:

		start_chunk: The beginning chunk the scan test starts from.

		stop_chunk: The last chunk the scan test stops at.

		scan_start: echo 1 to trigger scan test on cpu#.

		scan_result: It holds 64bit raw error code after scan.

		current_chunk: It shows the last chunk that was executed scan
		successfully.
